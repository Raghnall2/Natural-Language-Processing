## NLP Text Classification using TF-IDF and SVM

This project implements a text classification pipeline using TF-IDF vectorization
and Linear SVM, achieving 84.37% accuracy on the test set.

### Techniques Used
- Text preprocessing
- TF-IDF (unigram + bigram)
- Linear SVM classifier
- Model evaluation with accuracy and F1-score
